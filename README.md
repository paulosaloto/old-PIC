# old-PIC
Here are some old PIC programs I've done using PICC platform with PIC 16F84 and PIC 16F877.
These programs were made as assignments for Embbeded Systems subjects back in 2012. In each folder you can find the code files (*.c) along the PROTEUS simulation file (*.dsn) and the *.cof files for uploading in the simulation.
